    "\n",
    "### About Software Heritage\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Software Heritage project](https://www.softwareheritage.org) was started in 2015 with a rather impressive goal and purpose: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Software Heritage is an ambitious initiative that aims at collecting, organizing, preserving and sharing all the source code publicly available in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you read it well: all source code available in the world. It implies to build an equally impressive structure to hold the huge amount of information represented, make the archive available to the public through a [nice web interface](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/) and even propose a [well-documented API](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-web/) to access it seamlessly. For the records, there are also [various datasets available](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-dataset/graph/dataset.html) for download, with detailed instructions about how to set it up. And, yes it's huge: the full graph generated from the archive (with only metadata, content is not included) has more than 20b nodes and weights 1.2TB. Overall size of the archive is in the hundreds of TBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article presents, and demonstrates the use of, the [Software Heritage API](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api/1/) to query basic information about archived content and fetch the content of a software project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terms and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "For our activity we need to define the following terms and concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The repositories analysed by the SWH are registered as **origins**. Examples of origins are: https://bitbucket.org/anthroweb/apache.git, \thttps://github.com/apache/ant, or other types of sources (debian source packages, npmjs, pypi, cran..). \n",
    "* When repositories are analysed, it creates **snapshots**. Snapshots describe the state of the repository at the time of analysis, and provide links to the content. As an example in the case of a git repository, the snapshot links to the list of branches, which themselves link to revisions and content.\n",
    "* **Revisions** are consistent sets of directories and files representing the repository at a given time, like in a baseline. They can be conceptually mapped to commits in subversion, to git references, or to source package versions in debian or nmpjs repositories.\n",
    "* Revisions are linked to a **directory**, which itself links to other directories and **files** (aka blobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A full list of terms is provided in the [Software Heritage doc](https://wiki.softwareheritage.org/index.php?title=Glossary)."
